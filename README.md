# **Student Management**

## **Project Overview**

The Student Management project is a .NET Console application that demonstrates the use of Entity Framework Core (EF Core) to manage student enrollments in courses.
The project includes a relational data model with Students, Courses, and Enrollments and supports database migrations using EF Code-First and State-based migration approaches.

### Setup Entity Framework Core

**Install EF Core Packages**

To set up EF Core in the project, install the following packages:

`dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`         
`dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL`
`dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCorr.Tools`

### Define Data Model

The project uses the following entity classes to represent the schema:

**Student Entity**
* Student
* Id
* FirstName
* LastName
* Email
* EnrollmentDate


**Course Entity**

* Course
* Id
* Title
* Credits

**Enrollment Entity**

* Id
* StudentId
* CourseId
* Grade


### Create the Database Context

The SchoolContext class manages the database connection and entity mappings.

## Migration Approaches Overview

The project implements two migration strategies:

### 1. EF Code-First (Change-based)

1. [ ] Modify model classes.
3. [ ] Generate incremental migration files using EF CLI.
5. [ ] Produce migration artifacts (SQL scripts).



### 2. State-based

1. [ ] Write SQL migration scripts describing the final state of the schema.
3. [ ] Maintain a snapshot rather than incremental changes.
5. [ ] Each migration is managed in a separate Git branch.



## Git Branching Strategy for Migrations

### **Generating Migrations**
On the feat/initial-schema-ef branch, generate the initial migration:

[dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate]()

This generates a migration file in the Migrations folder.

### Create a SQL Artifact

To generate an SQL script artifact from the migration:

[dotnet ef migrations script -o Migrations/V1__InitialCreate.sql]()

For apply pending migrations to the database run:
[dotnet ef database update]()


### Migration: AddMiddleNameToStudent

On the feat/add-middle-name-ef branch, generate the migration to add a MiddleName column to the Students table:

[dotnet ef migrations add AddMiddleNameToStudent]()

### Create SQL Artifact for Migration

To generate an SQL script artifact for the AddMiddleNameToStudent migration:

[dotnet ef migrations script InitialCreate AddMiddleNameToStudent -o Migrations/V2__AddMiddleName.sql]()

### Migration: AddDateOfBirth
On the feat/add-dob-ef branch, generate the migration to add DateOfBirth column to the Students table:

[dotnet ef migrations add AddDateOfBirthToStudent]()

To generate an SQL script artifact for the AddDateOfBirthToStudent migration:

[dotnet ef migrations script AddMiddleNameToStudent AddDateOfBirthToStudent -o Migrations/V3__AddDateOfBirth.sql]()

### Migration: AddInstructor

Create the Instructor Model:
* Id
* FirstName
* LastName
* Email
* HireDate

Update the Course Model:
In Course.cs, add the foreign key and navigation property:
* InstructorId
* Instructor

Update DbContext:
In SchoolContext.cs, add:

[public DbSet<Instructor> Instructors { get; set; }]()

On branch feat/add-instructor-ef, run the migration:

[dotnet ef migrations add AddInstructorRelation]()

Create SQL Artifact for Migration:

[dotnet ef migrations script AddDateOfBirthToStudent AddInstructorRelation -o Migrations/V4__AddInstructorRelation.sql]()

Update Db: [dotnet ef database update]()


### Migration: RenameGradeToFinalGrade
On the feat/rename-grade-ef branch, generate the migration to rename Grade to FinalGrade in the Enrollments table:

[dotnet ef migrations add RenameGradeToFinalGrade]()

Create SQL Artifact for Migration:

[dotnet ef migrations script AddInstructorRelation RenameGradeToFinalGrade -o Migrations/V5__RenameGradeToFinalGrade.sql]()

## **## Destructive vs Non-Destructive Approach**

For renaming the Grade column to FinalGrade, I chose a destructive approach by using:

**ALTER TABLE "Enrollments" RENAME COLUMN "Grade" TO "FinalGrade";**

**_Why I Chose a Destructive Approach?_**

_1. Renaming a Column in PostgreSQL Is Safe__

PostgreSQL supports ALTER TABLE ... RENAME COLUMN as an atomic operation, meaning it happens instantly without affecting data integrity.

_2. No Data Loss Occurs_

The ALTER TABLE ... RENAME COLUMN command preserves all existing data in the column.

_3. _Immediate Codebase Updates Are Possible*__

If the application code is updated at the same time as the migration, thereâ€™s no risk of breaking functionality.

_4. _Minimizes Complexity__

Adding a new column, copying data, dropping the old one is unnecessary since we do not need to keep both names.

### Migration: AddDepartment
Create the Department Model:

*  Id 
* Name 
* Budget 
* StartDate
* DepartmentHeadId
* DepartmentHead 

Update DbContext:
[public DbSet<Department> Departments { get; set; }]()

On the feat/add-department-ef branch, generate the migration to add the Department entity and its relationship with Instructor:

[dotnet ef migrations add AddDepartmentRelation]()

To generate an SQL script artifact for the AddDepartmentRelation migration run:
[dotnet ef migrations script RenameGradeToFinalGrade AddDepartmentRelation -o Migrations/V6__AddDepartmentRelation.sql]()


### Migration: ModifyCourseCredits

On the feat/modify-credits-ef branch, generate the migration to change the Credits column type from int to decimal(5,2):
[dotnet ef migrations add ModifyCourseCredits]()

To generate an SQL script artifact for the ModifyCourseCredits migration:

[dotnet ef migrations script AddDepartmentRelation ModifyCourseCredits -o Migrations/V7__ModifyCourseCredits.sql]()

Since modifying a column type can result in data loss, we used a non-destructive approach:

1. Create a new temporary column Credits_temp.
2. Copy existing data to the new column.
3. Drop the old column Credits.
4. Rename Credits_temp to Credits.
